# Business-Process-Improvement-in-a-Food-Company

## Project Description

This project improves the business processes of a food processing company by introducing quality checks for raw materials and enhancing the workflow. The goal is to increase efficiency, reduce rework, and improve overall product quality. The project implements a TO-BE process that overcomes the gaps in the AS-IS process and incorporates database operations to support the new workflow.

## Repository Structure

- **AS IS Diagram.pdf**: Visual representation of the company's current (AS-IS) business process. It highlights the inefficiencies and gaps in the workflow.
  
- **TO BE DIAGRAM.pdf**: Visual representation of the improved (TO-BE) business process. It showcases the inclusion of a "Raw Material Quality Check" step and other improvements.

- **ERD OF FOOD PROCESSING COMPANY (1).pdf**: Entity-Relationship Diagram illustrating the database schema for managing the companyâ€™s processes, including suppliers, raw materials, and quality checks.

- **Phase-2_table_creation.sql**: SQL script to create the required tables for the database.

- **Phase-2_insert_scripts.sql**: SQL script containing sample insert statements to populate the database with initial data.

- **Phase-2_SQL_Queries.sql**: SQL script containing queries to retrieve and analyze data, supporting business decision-making and process improvements.

- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and its components.

## Getting Started

1. Review the **AS IS Diagram.pdf** and **TO BE DIAGRAM.pdf** to understand the problem and proposed solution.
2. Examine the **ERD OF FOOD PROCESSING COMPANY (1).pdf** for an overview of the database structure.
3. Execute the SQL scripts in the following order:
   - `Phase-2_table_creation.sql`
   - `Phase-2_insert_scripts.sql`
   - `Phase-2_SQL_Queries.sql`
4. Analyze the query results to validate the business improvements.

## Key Features

- **Improved Workflow**: Reduces rework by rejecting low-quality raw materials upfront.
- **Supplier Evaluation**: Helps identify and rate suppliers based on raw material quality.
- **Database Support**: Provides a robust structure for managing process data.

## Outcomes

The new TO-BE process ensures better quality control, reduces costs, and increases operational efficiency, making the business process more sustainable and reliable.
